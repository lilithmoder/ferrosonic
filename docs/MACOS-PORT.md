# macOS Port — Handover

This document records the state of the macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon) port and
contains a paste-ready prompt for an OpenCode session running on a Mac.

## Summary

- There is no prebuilt macOS binary and `install.sh` is Linux-only. A native
  build from source is the only way to run on macOS.
- The codebase is close to portable already. Build-time native dependencies are
  effectively nil: TLS is `rustls`, D-Bus is pure-Rust `zbus`, cover-art `chafa`
  is `dlopen`ed at runtime, and credentials use the platform keychain API.
- `x86_64-apple-darwin` (Intel) and `aarch64-apple-darwin` (Apple Silicon) are
  both Rust Tier-1 targets.
- **Status: unverified.** The changes below were developed and checked on Linux.
  The macOS module is `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` and therefore is not
  type-checked by the Linux build. The Mac session must build, fix, and smoke
  test.

## What changed in this branch

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/daemon/notify.rs` | Added a `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` `Notifier` that shells out to `osascript` (`display notification`). Widened the no-op stub gate to platforms other than Linux/macOS. The module-level doc now covers both backends. |
| `src/audio/pipewire.rs` | `PipeWireController` now records whether the construction probe could execute `pw-metadata`. When it cannot (missing binary, e.g. macOS), `set_rate` / `clear_forced_rate` are silent no-ops instead of warning on every track. Runner-injection tests are unaffected. |
| `README.md` | Marked PipeWire/WirePlumber/D-Bus as Linux-specific in the dependency table, corrected the stale "OpenSSL/D-Bus dev headers" build note, and added a macOS section (Homebrew deps, config path, feature caveats). |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | Added a report-only macOS build matrix for `x86_64-apple-darwin` (`macos-15-intel`) and `aarch64-apple-darwin` (`macos-15`). Nothing else in CI changed. |

## Feature behaviour on macOS

| Area | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Core playback (mpv) | Works. mpv uses CoreAudio. Gapless/prefetch flags are platform-neutral. |
| Daemon + queue persistence | Works. IPC is a Unix domain socket; with no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` it falls back to `/tmp/ferrosonic-<uid>/ferrosonicd.sock`. |
| Keychain | Works. keyring v4's default `v1` feature auto-selects macOS Keychain Services. |
| Cover art | Works. `probe_chafa` already tries `libchafa.dylib` and both Homebrew prefixes (`/opt/homebrew/lib` for ARM, `/usr/local/lib` for Intel). Terminal image protocols (iTerm2/kitty/sixel) are handled by `ratatui-image`. |
| Sample-rate switching | **Unavailable.** No PipeWire. Automatically skipped (no warning spam). The decoded quality readout still works. |
| Notifications | Implemented via `osascript`, text only (no cover art). |
| MPRIS | Compiles and runs against a D-Bus session bus, but macOS has no native MPRIS consumer, so it does **not** provide media-key / Control Center integration by itself. |
| systemd unit / installer | N/A. |

## Fast-build workflow (recommended)

Do not run full `cargo build --release` or `--all-targets` checks on the Mac:
the release profile uses whole-program LTO (`lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`)
and `--all-targets` compiles ~151 integration-test binaries. That combination
is what made the first port attempt unbearably slow. Two faster paths:

### A. Download a prebuilt artifact (no local build)

1. Push to `main` or `macos-port` on the fork
   (`https://github.com/lilithmoder/ferrosonic`) — every push builds a fresh
   artifact automatically.
2. Open the finished run under the Actions tab → **macos-release**, download
   `ferrosonic-macos-x86_64`, then:
   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 -c ferrosonic-macos-x86_64.sha256
   chmod +x ferrosonic-macos-x86_64
   ./ferrosonic-macos-x86_64 --standalone
   ```
   The first CI run compiles all dependencies cold (~20–40 min on the 3-core
   Intel runner); later runs reuse the cache and are much quicker. The Mac
   itself never compiles anything.

### B. Local fast iteration on the Mac

For fixing the macOS-only compile errors (the `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`
code is not type-checked by the Linux build):

1. Toolchain and runtime:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   brew install llvm mpv cava chafa dbus   # dbus only for MPRIS
   ```
2. Faster linker (`~/.cargo/config.toml`, user-level, not committed; Homebrew
   prefix is `/usr/local` on Intel):
   ```toml
   [target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
   linker = "clang"
   rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/ld64.lld"]
   ```
3. Compile-error loop (metadata only, no codegen or link):
   `cargo check --bin ferrosonic`
4. Run/debug build (dev profile, no LTO, incremental):
   `cargo build --bin ferrosonic && ./target/debug/ferrosonic --standalone`
5. Optimized-but-quick local build:
   `cargo build --profile release-fast --bin ferrosonic`
6. Never run `cargo clippy --all-targets` or `cargo nextest` on the Mac; run
   those on the Linux host or let CI do it.

Smoke test with whichever binary you have, then report back: exact commands,
observed output, code fixes (file:line), and any remaining failures.

## Mac-side checklist (full verification, once the binary runs)

1. Toolchain and runtime (only needed for path B):
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   brew install mpv cava chafa dbus   # dbus only for MPRIS
   ```
2. Smoke test: see the prompt below.
3. Report back: exact commands, observed output, code fixes (file:line), and any
   remaining failures.

## Decision points to settle on the Mac

1. **Native media keys.** If media-key / Control Center integration is required
   (it was listed as a priority), MPRIS is not sufficient on macOS. Options:
   a native Now Playing backend (`souvlaki`, `ctrl`, or a small Objective-C
   shim around `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` + `MPRemoteCommandCenter`), or accept
   that media keys are unavailable. This is a new subsystem, not a `cfg` fix —
   scope it separately.
2. **Notification cover art.** `osascript` cannot attach an image. If cover art
   in notifications matters, the fallback is the Homebrew `terminal-notifier`
   binary (`-contentImage`), used only when present.
3. **Gate the macOS build.** The old report-only `build_macos` matrix in
   `test.yml` was folded into the `macos-release` workflow, which now builds
   the macOS binary and runs a lib+bins clippy pass on every push to
   `main`/`macos-port`. To make that block instead of just report, have the
   clippy step use `-D warnings` once the port is verified on hardware.

## Transfer

All work — the personal features, the macOS port, and the fast-build tooling —
lives on the fork at `https://github.com/lilithmoder/ferrosonic`:

- `main` (default branch): the primary development line. Future features land
  here, so they are never left out of the macOS build.
- `macos-port`: branch for Mac-side porting and verification work. Merge
  `main` into it (or fast-forward it) to pick up new features; the
  `macos-release` workflow builds artifacts on pushes to either branch.
- `master`: untouched mirror of the upstream project, used for pulling
  upstream updates.

On the Mac:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lilithmoder/ferrosonic.git   # lands on main
cd ferrosonic
```

(The changes were previously moved as `ferrosonic-macos-port.bundle`; the fork
replaces that.)

## Paste-ready prompt for the Mac session

```text
You are working in the Ferrosonic repo (a Rust terminal Subsonic client). The
project was developed for Linux (PipeWire sample-rate switching, freedesktop
D-Bus notifications/MPRIS). A macOS-prepared patch is applied to the working
tree. Your job is to build it natively on this Intel Mac, fix any remaining
target-specific compile errors, validate runtime behaviour, and report.

Constraints:
- Platform-specific code stays behind #[cfg(target_os = "macos")].
- Do not add dependencies without justification; prefer shelling out to system
  tools for small jobs.
- No unwrap()/expect() in production code. Run `cargo fmt` when done.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.

Setup:
  xcode-select --install
  rustup toolchain install stable
  brew install mpv cava chafa dbus   # dbus only if you test MPRIS

Build and lint:
1. cd upstream && cargo build --release
   Fix compile errors only; keep changes minimal.
2. cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

Smoke test (record exact commands and observed results):
- Standalone playback: ./target/release/ferrosonic --standalone against a test
  Navidrome config. Verify play/pause, seek, next/prev, gapless, queue edits,
  ReplayGain, cover art (iTerm2/kitty/sixel), cava, resize, and mouse input.
- Daemon: run normally (daemon mode on). Confirm the daemon auto-spawns
  detached, the TUI reconnects, and the queue + position persist across a
  daemon restart (check queue.json). Confirm --standalone still works.
- Keychain: set the password on the Server page (F5). Confirm it lands in the
  macOS Keychain (`security find-generic-password -s ferrosonic`) and is not
  written as plaintext in the config.
- Notifications: with Notifications=true, play tracks and confirm a banner
  appears. If not, capture the log line and the osascript stderr and report.
- MPRIS: `brew services start dbus` (or `dbus-launch --sh-syntax`), then check:
    dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus \
      /org/freedesktop/DBus org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames | grep mpris
  Note: macOS has no native MPRIS consumer, so media keys will NOT work via
  MPRIS. Report this and give a recommendation on native Now Playing.

Notes:
- Config/logs/queue live under ~/Library/Application Support/ferrosonic/.
  Override with FERROSONIC_CONFIG_DIR.
- PipeWire is absent; sample-rate switching is expected to be skipped silently.
- The daemon IPC socket falls back to /tmp/ferrosonic-<uid>/ferrosonicd.sock.

Final report: commands run, results, code fixes (file:line), skipped checks, and
remaining risks. Do not claim success just because it compiles.
```
