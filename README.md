# Ferrosonic

A terminal Subsonic music client written in Rust: bit-perfect audio, gapless playback, and full desktop integration.

It is a ground-up Rust rewrite of [Termsonic](https://git.sixfoisneuf.fr/termsonic/about/) (a Go client by [SixFoisNeuf](https://www.sixfoisneuf.fr/posts/termsonic-a-terminal-client-for-subsonic/)), adding PipeWire sample-rate switching, MPRIS2 controls, themes, and mouse support.

## Features

### Audio

- **Bit-perfect output** - PipeWire switches the system sample rate to match the source (44.1, 48, 96, 192 kHz and others) and restores it on exit.
- **Gapless playback** - the next track is pre-buffered into mpv before the current one ends.
- **Quality readout** - live sample rate, bit depth, codec, and channel layout.
- **Visualizer** - built-in cava pane with theme-matched gradient colors.
- **ReplayGain** - track/album/off mode, preamp, and clip prevention, applied via mpv and adjustable live from Settings (`F6`).
- **Offline track cache** - optional: streamed tracks are cached on disk and replayed locally, with LRU eviction under a size cap (`OfflineCacheEnabled` / `OfflineCacheMaxMb`, `F6` Settings).

### Library and queue

- **Tree browser** - expandable artist/album view, with a flat album-list toggle (`v`).
- **Unified search** - `/` runs one server-side `search3` across artists, albums, and songs together.
- **Multi-library** - on multi-folder servers, `f` scopes the tree, album list, random songs, and search to one music folder; remembered across restarts.
- **Quick Play** - jump straight into Starred or Random songs, a Random Album,
  or server-curated Newest, Recently Played, Most Played, and Highest Rated albums.
- **Stars** - favourite tracks with `n` (playing) or `m` (highlighted); shown with a star everywhere.
- **Ratings** - rate the playing track 1-5 (`1`-`5`) or the highlighted one (`Alt+1`-`Alt+5`); press the current rating again to clear it. Synced to the server and exposed via MPRIS.
- **Playback filters** - exclude songs from the queue by rating, year, duration, genre, or artist from Settings (`F6`) or `config.toml`. Applies wherever songs enter the queue (enqueue, shuffle, auto-continue).
- **Shuffle and repeat** - shuffle any artist, album, or the whole library; cycle repeat Off/One/All with `r`.
- **Queue** - add, remove, reorder, shuffle, and clear history; persists across daemon restarts; save as a server playlist with `s`.
- **Playlists** - browse, play, and fully edit server playlists (rename, delete, add/remove/reorder songs).
- **Multi-disc albums** - correct disc and track numbering.

### Desktop integration

- **Persistent playback** - an optional background daemon keeps music playing after you close the terminal. [Details below](#persistent-playback).
- **MPRIS2** - full media-key control (play, pause, stop, next, previous, seek) with push-style `PropertiesChanged` updates.
- **Notifications** - track-change desktop notifications with cover art, fired daemon-side so they appear with the TUI closed (mako, dunst, GNOME, KDE).
- **Scrobbling** - reports plays via classic `scrobble` plus the OpenSubsonic `reportPlayback` extension when the server advertises it (Last.fm / ListenBrainz when linked server-side).

### Interface

- **Responsive layouts** - page tabs and transport controls wrap on narrow
  terminals; Library, Playlists, and Quick Play stack their panes when a
  side-by-side split would make the content too narrow.
- **13 themes** - Default, Monokai, Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, Catppuccin, Solarized, Tokyo Night, Rosé Pine, Everforest, Kanagawa, One Dark, Ayu Dark; plus custom TOML themes in `~/.config/ferrosonic/themes/`.
- **Cover art** - kitty / iTerm2 / sixel image protocols, with a chafa-enhanced half-block fallback.
- **Mouse support** - clickable tabs, buttons, lists, and progress-bar seeking.
- **Keyboard-driven** - Vim-style `j`/`k` alongside arrow keys; global shortcuts (quit, play/pause, page switches, ...) are remappable from Settings or via `[Keybindings]` in `config.toml`.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Ferrosonic requires the following at runtime:

| Dependency | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|
| **mpv** | Audio playback engine (via JSON IPC). 0.38+ recommended; older versions run a playback compatibility path (ferrosonic detects the version and warns). | Yes |
| **PipeWire** | Automatic sample rate switching for bit-perfect audio (Linux) | Recommended |
| **WirePlumber** | PipeWire session manager (Linux) | Recommended |
| **D-Bus** | MPRIS2 desktop media controls (Linux session bus; macOS needs `dbus` too) | Recommended |
| **cava** | Audio visualizer | Optional |
| **chafa** | Higher-fidelity cover-art half-blocks (sextants / braille / dithering). Loaded via `dlopen` at runtime; if absent, ferrosonic falls back to primitive `▀▄` half-blocks. | Optional |

### Quick Install

Supports Arch, Fedora, and Debian/Ubuntu (Linux only). Installs runtime dependencies, downloads the latest precompiled binary, and installs to `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaidaken/ferrosonic/master/install.sh | sh
```

The install drops a single `ferrosonic` binary into `/usr/local/bin/`. It runs as the TUI by default and re-launches itself in the background as the daemon when persistent playback is enabled.

### Build from Source

You need a Rust toolchain. No C libraries are linked at build time: TLS uses
`rustls`, D-Bus is pure-Rust `zbus`, cover-art `chafa` is loaded via `dlopen`
at runtime, and the keychain uses the platform API. Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaidaken/ferrosonic.git
cd ferrosonic
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/ferrosonic /usr/local/bin/
```

### macOS

`install.sh` is Linux-only. Two ways to get a binary on macOS:

- **Download a CI artifact** (recommended): every push to `main`/`macos-port`
  builds a `ferrosonic-macos-x86_64` binary plus SHA-256 under the Actions
  tab (`macos-release` workflow). See `docs/MACOS-PORT.md` for the workflow,
  the fast local build loop, and macOS caveats.
- **Build from source.** Homebrew supplies the runtime pieces:

```bash
xcode-select --install                       # Command Line Tools
brew install mpv                             # required playback engine
brew install cava chafa                      # optional: visualizer / better half-blocks
brew install dbus                            # optional: only if you want MPRIS
cargo build --profile release-fast --bin ferrosonic   # optimized, much faster than --release
./target/release-fast/ferrosonic             # add --standalone to skip the daemon
```

macOS differences and limitations:

- **Config, logs, and queue** live under `~/Library/Application Support/ferrosonic/`
  (macOS's config dir, not `~/.config`). Override with `FERROSONIC_CONFIG_DIR`.
- **Passwords** are stored in the macOS Keychain, the equivalent of Secret
  Service on Linux.
- **No bit-perfect sample-rate switching.** macOS has no PipeWire, so
  `pw-metadata` is unavailable and rate matching is skipped automatically.
  Playback still goes through mpv and CoreAudio; the quality readout still shows
  the decoded rate.
- **Notifications** use `osascript`'s `display notification`. They are text-only
  (no cover art), because AppleScript's notification API has no image field.
- **MPRIS** requires a D-Bus session bus (`brew services start dbus`, or
  `dbus-launch`). macOS has no native MPRIS consumer, so this alone does not wire
  up the media keys / Control Center; a native Now Playing backend would be
  needed for that.
- **Persistent playback** works. With no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, the daemon IPC
  socket falls back to `/tmp/ferrosonic-<uid>/ferrosonicd.sock`.

## Usage

```bash
# Run with default config (~/.config/ferrosonic/config.toml)
ferrosonic

# Run with a custom config file
ferrosonic -c /path/to/config.toml

# Enable verbose/debug logging
ferrosonic -v

# Force single-process mode (skip the daemon connect/auto-spawn)
ferrosonic --standalone
```

### Persistent playback

By default, `ferrosonic` connects to a background daemon and auto-spawns one (the same binary re-exec'd with the internal `--daemon` flag) if it isn't running. Music then keeps playing when you close the terminal. Reopen `ferrosonic` and you'll see the same queue at the same position.

Turn it off in Settings (`F6 → Daemon: Off`) for a single-process mode where music stops when the TUI exits. Or use `--standalone` for a one-off launch without changing the config.

For users who want the daemon at login time, a systemd user unit is shipped under [`contrib/ferrosonicd.service`](contrib/ferrosonicd.service):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp contrib/ferrosonicd.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user enable --now ferrosonicd.service
```

## Configuration

Configuration is stored at `~/.config/ferrosonic/config.toml`. You can edit it manually or configure the server connection through the application's Server page (F5). When you enter your password on the Server page, ferrosonic saves it to your operating system's keychain by default and keeps it out of `config.toml`; see [Where your password is stored](#where-your-password-is-stored).

```toml
BaseURL = "https://your-subsonic-server.com"
Username = "your-username"
Password = "your-password"
Theme = "Default"
Daemon = true
Cava = false
CavaSize = 40
AutoContinue = false
StreamOnStart = true
SearchDebounceMs = 200
SearchArtistLimit = 100
SearchAlbumLimit = 100
SearchSongLimit = 200
ResumeOnStart = true
AutoplayOnStart = false
OfflineCacheEnabled = false
OfflineCacheMaxMb = 2048
RepeatMode = "Off"
CoverArt = false
CoverArtSize = 16
Scrobble = true
Notifications = true
ReplayGainMode = "no"
ReplayGainPreamp = 0.0
ReplayGainClip = false
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `BaseURL` | URL of your Subsonic-compatible server (Navidrome, Airsonic, Gonic, etc.). May include a path prefix if the server sits behind a reverse proxy, e.g. `https://example.com/music` - with or without a trailing slash |
| `Username` | Your server username |
| `Password` | Your server password. Used inline only as a last resort; the Server page prefers the OS keychain. |
| `PasswordKeyring` | Set to `true` automatically when the password lives in the OS keychain; no plaintext is then written to the config. See below. |
| `PasswordFile` | Optional path to a file containing the password (overrides `Password` and the keychain) |
| `PasswordEval` | Optional command whose output is the password, so no secret sits in the config. Overrides `PasswordFile`, the keychain, and `Password`; the `FERROSONIC_PASSWORD` env var still wins. See below. |
| `Theme` | Color theme name (e.g. `Default`, `Catppuccin`, `Tokyo Night`) |
| `Daemon` | `true` (default) auto-spawns the background daemon; `false` runs single-process |
| `Cava` | Enable the cava visualizer pane |
| `CavaSize` | Cava pane height percentage (10-80, step 5) |
| `AutoContinue` | Fetch fresh random songs and keep playing when the queue ends |
| `StreamOnStart` | `true` (default) streams a cold queue start and begins as soon as mpv has data; `false` downloads the whole track first for a guaranteed clean start on slow networks |
| `SearchDebounceMs` | Milliseconds to wait after the last keystroke before running `search3`, default 200 (`0` disables). The Library filter records recent queries and recalls them with Up/Down while editing |
| `SearchArtistLimit` | Maximum artist search results, default 100 |
| `SearchAlbumLimit` | Maximum album search results, default 100 |
| `SearchSongLimit` | Maximum song search results, default 200 |
| `ResumeOnStart` | `true` (default) restores the queue, current track, and playhead on the next daemon start, paused. `false` starts empty |
| `AutoplayOnStart` | `true` auto-plays a restored session instead of restoring it paused. Default `false` |
| `OfflineCacheEnabled` | `true` caches streamed tracks under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ferrosonic/tracks` so repeat and offline queue plays do not re-fetch. Default `false` |
| `OfflineCacheMaxMb` | Offline cache size cap in MiB, default 2048; least-recently-used tracks are evicted past it |
| `RepeatMode` | Queue repeat: `"Off"`, `"One"`, or `"All"` |
| `CoverArt` | Show cover art in the now-playing section (kitty / iTerm2 / sixel terminals) |
| `CoverArtSize` | Cover art pane width in columns (default 16) |
| `Scrobble` | Report plays to the server, default `true` (classic `scrobble` + OpenSubsonic `reportPlayback`) |
| `Notifications` | Desktop track-change notifications with cover art, default `true` |
| `ReplayGainMode` | ReplayGain adjustment mode: `"no"`, `"track"`, or `"album"`, default `"no"`. Passed to mpv and applied live if a track is playing. |
| `ReplayGainPreamp` | ReplayGain preamp offset in dB, `-15.0` to `15.0`, default `0.0`. Values must be finite; NaN and infinities are rejected |
| `ReplayGainClip` | Prevent clipping from ReplayGain amplification, default `false` |

Logs are written to `~/.config/ferrosonic/ferrosonic.log` (TUI) and `~/.config/ferrosonic/ferrosonicd.log` (daemon). The queue is persisted to `~/.config/ferrosonic/queue.json` so it survives daemon restarts.

### Playback filters

Exclude songs from ever entering the queue - whether from adding a song/album/playlist, shuffling the library, or auto-continue's random pick - by rating, year, duration, genre, or artist. All filters have Settings-page rows (`F6`); select Excluded Genres or Excluded Artists and press Enter for the list editor. Filters are not applied retroactively to an already-persisted queue or when just browsing the library - they only govern what gets added going forward. If a filter excludes everything from a given add, ferrosonic shows a notification instead of silently doing nothing.

```toml
[PlaybackFilters]
MinRating = 2                    # exclude songs rated 1 or 2; 0 (default) disables this filter
YearMin = 1970
YearMax = 2010
DurationMinSecs = 60
DurationMaxSecs = 600
ExcludedGenres = ["Podcast", "Christmas"]
ExcludedArtists = ["Some Artist"]
```

All fields are optional and independently combinable; omit a field (or the whole table) to leave that criterion unrestricted. Genre/artist matching is case-insensitive.

### Custom keybindings

The 15 global (page-independent) shortcuts - quit, play/pause, next/previous track, star-playing, lyrics, shuffle-library, cycle-repeat, refresh, and the six `F1`-`F6` page switches - can be remapped from Settings (`F6` → Global Keybinds) or in a `[Keybindings]` table. The editor captures the next pressed chord, rejects collisions and reserved keys, can reset one action or all actions, and applies saved changes immediately. Config values use chord strings such as `"q"`, `"F1"`, `"Space"`, and `"Ctrl+r"`; a shifted letter can be written as `"T"` or `"Shift+t"`. Per-page bindings and modal overlays remain fixed. `p` (secondary pause alias) and the rating keys (`1`-`5` and `Alt+1`-`Alt+5`) are always reserved and can't be remapped or shadowed.

```toml
[Keybindings]
Quit = "Ctrl+q"
NextTrack = "j"
PreviousTrack = "k"
ShuffleLibrary = "s"
```

An override using a reserved key is logged and reported as unreachable. Any action left out keeps its default binding. Manual `config.toml` edits are read at startup; changes saved through the in-app editor take effect immediately. A key chord claimed by two actions is a config error, logged and reported once in the TUI at startup; the editor prevents creating these conflicts.

### Where your password is stored

When you enter your password on the Server page (F5), ferrosonic stores it in your operating system's keychain (Secret Service / GNOME Keyring / KWallet on Linux, Keychain on macOS) and writes only a `PasswordKeyring = true` marker to `config.toml`, never the plaintext. Any password already sitting inline migrates to the keychain the next time you save. This is the default and needs no setup.

On a machine with no usable keychain (a headless box, or no unlocked Secret Service), ferrosonic falls back to writing the password inline to `config.toml`, which is created with owner-only (`0600`) permissions, and the Server page tells you this happened. For headless or scripted setups, prefer `PasswordEval` below.

At startup the password is resolved in this order, first hit wins:

1. `FERROSONIC_PASSWORD` environment variable
2. `PasswordEval` command
3. `PasswordFile` path
4. OS keychain (when `PasswordKeyring = true`)
5. inline `Password`

If a higher-priority source is configured but fails (command errors, file unreadable, keychain unreachable), ferrosonic clears the password and authentication fails cleanly rather than falling back to a stale credential.

### Keeping the password out of the config (`PasswordEval`)

`PasswordEval` runs a command and uses its first line of output as the password, so no secret is stored in `config.toml`. It works with whatever secret tooling you already use (`pass`, `gpg`, `sops`, `secret-tool`, a keyring CLI, and so on). Two forms:

```toml
# String, run via the shell (env vars, ~, and pipes work):
PasswordEval = "pass show navidrome"

# Array, executed directly with no shell (env vars and ~ still expand):
PasswordEval = ["sops", "-d", "~/secrets/navidrome.txt"]
```

It is resolved at startup. Because the background daemon has no terminal, **the command must be non-interactive**: use an agent-backed source (`gpg-agent` or `pass` with the key already unlocked, `sops`, `secret-tool`) rather than anything that pops a passphrase prompt. The command runs with stdin closed and is killed if it does not return within 30 seconds; on any failure ferrosonic clears the password and authentication fails cleanly rather than falling back to a stale credential. The password is never passed as a command argument or environment variable, so it cannot leak through the process table.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Global

The bindings in this section (except `p`/`Space` for pause and the `1`-`5` / `Alt+1`-`Alt+5` rating keys) are remappable via `[Keybindings]`; see [Custom keybindings](#custom-keybindings). Per-page bindings further down are not.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `q` | Quit |
| `p` / `Space` | Toggle play/pause |
| `l` | Next track |
| `h` | Previous track |
| `n` | Star/unstar currently-playing song |
| `y` | Open lyrics for the currently-playing song |
| `1`-`5` | Rate the currently-playing song 1-5; press the current rating again to clear it |
| `Alt+1`-`Alt+5` | Rate the *highlighted* song instead. On the Library page the song list must have focus (`→`), the same rule `m` follows - ferrosonic tells you if nothing is highlighted |
| `r` | Cycle repeat mode (Off → One → All) |
| `Shift+T` | Shuffle the entire library and play |
| `Ctrl+R` | Refresh data from server |
| `F1` | Library page |
| `F2` | Queue page |
| `F3` | Quick Play page |
| `F4` | Playlists page |
| `F5` | Server configuration page |
| `F6` | Settings page |

### Lyrics overlay

Press `y` from any page while a track is loaded. Ferrosonic prefers structured
and synchronized OpenSubsonic lyrics when the server advertises `songLyrics`,
and falls back to the classic Subsonic lyrics endpoint on compatible older
servers. Results are cached for the current TUI session.

Use `j`/`k`, the arrow keys, or Page Up/Page Down to scroll; `f` toggles
follow-current-line mode. Timestamped lyrics follow the exact active line;
untimed lyrics scroll proportionally with track progress and label this as an
estimate. Left/Right selects another language or source, `r` retries, and `y`
or Escape closes the overlay.

### Library Page (F1)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `/` | Unified search: typing fires one server-side `search3` across artists, albums, and songs |
| `Enter` | Lock the filter in (keeps results, exits input mode) |
| `Esc` | Clear filter and search results |
| `Up` / `k` | Move selection up |
| `Down` / `j` | Move selection down |
| `Left` / `Right` | Switch focus between tree and song list |
| `Enter` | Expand/collapse artist, or play album/song |
| `Backspace` | Return to tree from song list |
| `e` | Add selected item to end of queue |
| `i` | Add selected item as next in queue |
| `t` | Shuffle play all songs by the selected artist or album |
| `m` | Star/unstar highlighted song (songs pane focus only) |
| `v` | Toggle the left pane between the artist tree and the flat album list |
| `f` | Cycle the active library / music folder (All, then each folder); shown in the pane title |
| `I` (Shift+i) | Show artist/album information overlay (biography/notes, similar artists, external links) |

Search requests are debounced (`SearchDebounceMs`, default 200ms) so a query fires once per typing pause rather than per keypress, and the pane title shows the artist/album/song result counts. Matching text is highlighted in the result rows. While editing the filter, `Up`/`Down` walk back through your recent queries (most recent first); the last 20 are remembered across restarts.

Press `I` on a highlighted artist or album for an information overlay: biography or liner notes, similar artists, and Last.fm/MusicBrainz links. The data comes from the server's `getArtistInfo2`/`getAlbumInfo2`; Navidrome only fills it when an external (Last.fm) integration is configured, so without one the overlay shows a clean empty state. `j`/`k`/Page Up/Page Down scroll, `r` retries, and `I` or Escape closes.

### Queue Page (F2)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Up` / `k` | Move selection up |
| `Down` / `j` | Move selection down |
| `Enter` | Play selected song |
| `d` | Remove selected song from queue (advances to next if removing current) |
| `J` (Shift+J) | Move selected song down |
| `K` (Shift+K) | Move selected song up |
| `t` | Shuffle queue (current song stays in place) |
| `c` | Clear played history (remove songs before current) |
| `s` | Save the current queue as a server-side playlist |
| `m` | Star/unstar highlighted song |

### Quick Play Page (F3)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Switch focus between song options and song list |
| `Left` / `Right` | Switch focus between options pane and song list |
| `Up` / `k` | Move selection up (a full option row when the pane wraps) |
| `Down` / `j` | Move selection down (a full option row when the pane wraps) |
| `Enter` | Play selected song (queues all visible songs and starts from selection) |
| `m` | Star/unstar highlighted song |

The Quick Play page has seven modes selectable from the options pane:

- **Starred** shows your starred/favourited songs from the server.
- **Random** fetches a fresh 500-song roll from the active library.
- **Random Album** fetches one random full album.
- **Newest Album**, **Recently Played**, **Most Played**, and **Highest Rated**
  fetch the complete track list of the first album in the corresponding
  server-curated `getAlbumList2` category. Highest Rated therefore follows the
  album's server rating rather than calculating an average from song ratings.

Album modes follow the active music folder. A category with no matching album
shows an explicit empty message instead of a blank song pane.

Returning to F3 or clicking an already selected Random Album retains that album. Switch to another option and back to fetch a new one. On a narrow terminal the options pane wraps into multiple columns, and `Up`/`Down` move by a whole row to match; `Ctrl+R` refreshes the active mode without resetting the selection to Starred. Ctrl/Alt chords that are not global keybindings do not trigger page shortcuts.

### Playlists Page (F4)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` / `Left` / `Right` | Switch focus between playlists and songs |
| `Up` / `k` | Move selection up |
| `Down` / `j` | Move selection down |
| `Enter` | Load playlist songs or play selected song |
| `e` | Add selected item to end of queue |
| `i` | Add selected song as next in queue |
| `t` | Shuffle play all songs in selected playlist |
| `m` | Star/unstar highlighted song (songs pane focus only) |
| `R` | Rename the selected playlist (playlists pane) |
| `D` | Delete the selected playlist, with a confirmation prompt (playlists pane) |
| `d` | Remove the highlighted song from the playlist (songs pane) |
| `J` / `K` | Move the highlighted song down / up to reorder (songs pane) |
| `a` | Add the highlighted song to another playlist via a picker (songs pane) |

Reordering replaces the server playlist's contents in one request, since the
Subsonic API has no in-place move. The `a` add-to-playlist picker is also
available from the Library, Queue, and Quick Play song panes.

### Server Page (F5)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Move between fields |
| `Enter` | Test connection or Save configuration |
| `Backspace` | Delete character in text field |

F-keys still switch pages from the Server page; any unsaved edits are discarded
on the way out. Password text reverts to the last locally loaded or successfully
saved credential (the daemon's configuration snapshots intentionally omit it).

### Settings Page (F6)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Up` / `Down` | Move between settings |
| `Left` | Previous option |
| `Right` / `Enter` | Next option |

The genre, artist, and global-keybind rows open modal editors with Enter. In the filter editors use `a` to add, `d` to remove, `Ctrl+S` to save, and `Esc` to cancel. In the keybinding editor use Enter to capture a chord, `d` to reset one action, `D` to reset all, `Ctrl+S` to save, and `Esc` to cancel.

Settings include theme selection, cava visualizer toggle + size, cover art toggle + size, repeat mode, auto-continue, stream on start, resume on start, autoplay on start, offline cache + size, scrobbling, desktop notifications, ReplayGain mode/preamp/clip prevention, all playback filters, global keybindings, and the daemon-mode preference. Scalar changes save automatically; the two list editors save with `Ctrl+S`. ReplayGain applies live to mpv where relevant, and saved keybindings apply live to the TUI. The daemon-mode toggle takes effect on the next launch. Note `h`/`l`/`Space` are fixed field controls on this page.

**Stream on start** (`StreamOnStart`, on by default) controls how a cold queue begins. When on, ferrosonic hands mpv the authenticated `rest/stream` URL and playback starts as soon as enough data has arrived; when off, the whole track is downloaded to a local temp file first, guaranteeing a clean start from frame 0 at the cost of waiting for the full download on slow or flaky networks. Turning it off restores the earlier full pre-buffer behavior. Gapless playback is unaffected either way: the next track is preloaded and prefetched by mpv.

## Mouse Support

- Click page tabs in the header to switch pages
- Click playback control buttons (Previous, Play, Pause, Stop, Next) in the header
- Click items in lists to select them
- Click the progress bar in the Now Playing widget to seek

## Audio Features

### Bit-Perfect Playback

Ferrosonic uses PipeWire's `pw-metadata` to automatically switch the system sample rate to match the source material. When a track at 96kHz starts playing, PipeWire is instructed to output at 96kHz, avoiding unnecessary resampling. The original sample rate is restored when the application exits.

### Gapless Playback

The next track in the queue is pre-loaded into MPV's internal playlist before the current track finishes, allowing seamless transitions with no gap or click between songs.

### Now Playing Display

The Now Playing widget shows:
- Artist, album, and track title
- Audio quality: format/codec, bit depth, sample rate, and channel layout
- Visual progress bar with elapsed/total time

## Themes
Ferrosonic ships multiple built-in themes, as well as support for custom themes. Here are two examples:
<!-- A file in docs/ should be added with every built-in theme to show them off fully, these are just examples -->

| Nord | Gruvbox |
|---|---|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/nord_theme.avif" alt="Nord theme" width="640" height="327" /> | <img src="docs/screenshots/gruvbox_theme.avif" alt="Gruvbox theme" width="640" height="327" /> |

To know more about themes, **visit the [themes documentation](docs/themes.md)**.

## Compatible Servers

Ferrosonic works with any server implementing the Subsonic API, including:

- [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/)
- [Airsonic](https://airsonic.github.io/)
- [Airsonic-Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced)
- [Gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic)
- [Supysonic](https://github.com/spl0k/supysonic)

## Testing

The full test suite uses `cargo-nextest` for parallel execution and
`wiremock` / a fake-mpv harness for integration tests against the daemon,
audio stack, and Subsonic client without spawning real services. One
optional smoke test runs against real `mpv` to catch protocol drift.

```bash
# Run everything (fast).
cargo nextest run --all-targets

# Or vanilla cargo if you don't have nextest installed.
cargo test --all-targets

# Coverage report (HTML + summary).
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov

CI runs fmt, clippy, the full test suite (with real `mpv` installed),
and a coverage report on every push and pull request. Coverage is
reported as a warning, not a hard gate.

Ferrosonic is inspired by [Termsonic](https://git.sixfoisneuf.fr/termsonic/about/) by SixFoisNeuf, a terminal Subsonic client written in Go. Ferrosonic builds on that concept with a Rust implementation, bit-perfect audio via PipeWire, and additional features.
